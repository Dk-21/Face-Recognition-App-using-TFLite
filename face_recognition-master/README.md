### Introduction

**_“is it possible to make an app that compares faces on mobile_**  
**_without an Internet connection? How accurate could it be?_**_”_. 
deep learning model is used for higher accuracy and efficiency. It uses the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network to accurate verify faces on mobile.


What are the key features of this app?
-   It recognizes faces **very accurately**
-   It works **offline**, in **real time**
-   It uses a **mobile-oriented** **deep learning** architecture

**An example of the working app.** Will Farrell (the comedian) vs Chad Smith (the drummer). People usually confuse them. First the faces are registered in the dataset, then the app recognizes the faces in runtime. Tested on my Google Pixel 3.
